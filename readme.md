# Finding connected components

In this project we have worked with different approaches to finding and analysingconnections between different data types using Tarjan’s SCC algorithm and DB-SCAN algorithm.  Strongly connected components, found by the first algorithm,can give us useful information about graph connectivity. The DBSCAN algorithmallows to successfully determine partitions of points, thus it is a reliable solution forclustering. The both algorithms were tested on random datasets, synthetic and real-life datasets and on the same dataset in order to better understand their differencesand common points.
